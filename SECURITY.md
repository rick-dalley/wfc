# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

The `wfc` team and community take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any findings. We are committed to working with you to resolve security issues promptly.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/rick-dalley/wfc/security/advisories/new) tab.

Once your report is received, the `wfc` team will:

1. Acknowledge receipt of your report and provide an initial response.
2. Investigate the issue and work towards a resolution.
3. Keep you informed of the progress and any relevant updates.
4. Coordinate the release of a fix and public disclosure of the vulnerability.

### Third-Party Modules

If the vulnerability is in a third-party dependency used by `wfc`, please report the issue directly to the maintainers of the affected module.

## Security Best Practices

To help secure applications built using `wfc`, we encourage you to follow recommended [Github best practices](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security).
